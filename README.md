# ViewRecorder

Android View-level screen area recording scheme (support for SurfaceView and TextureView)

The class is very easy to use, since it extends MediaRecord with only one extra API to set or switch recorded view.

Moreover, here is a class named SurfaceMediaRecorder which extends MediaRecord directly. Video frame is composed periodically according to frame rate, as each frame composing exposed with interface, you can customize it as you want. Meanwhile, you can assign any looper for composing, e.g. a background looper in case of your main thread is heavy or composing is slow.
